twuewand, a truerand algorithm for generating entropy

ABOUT

twuewand is software that creates hardware-generated random data.  It 
accomplishes this by exploiting the fact that the CPU clock and the 
RTC (real-time clock) are physically separate, and that time and work 
are not linked.

INSTALLATION

twuewand requires Perl 5.6.0 or newer, and several Perl modules, all 
of which are in a standard Perl installation (though your distribution 
may split Perl into "base" and "standard" packages). Several 
non-standard packages are required for optional (but recommended) 
features, and can be installed from your distribution's package 
management system or CPAN. They are:

  Digest::SHA (for SHA256 debiasing, and Kaminsky debiasing)
  Crypt::Rijndael (AES256; for Kaminsky debiasing)

To build and install twuewand:

  make
  make test
  make install
  make clean

On Linux systems, a small C program will also be compiled called 
rndaddentropy.  This is a wrapper for the RNDADDENTROPY ioctl, and is 
used for directly adding entropy to the Linux primary pool.  Please 
see its manpage for more details.

USAGE

Please see the twuewand manpage for invocation options.
