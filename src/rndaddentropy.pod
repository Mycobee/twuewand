=head1 NAME

rndaddentropy - an RNDADDENTROPY ioctl wrapper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

$ENTROPY_GENERATOR | B<rndaddentropy>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rndaddentropy> is used to pipe entropy directly into Linux's primary 
entropy pool.  This requires superuser privileges.

Adding entropy directly to the primary entropy pool can be very 
dangerous, a predictable entropy increases the predictability of 
resulting data from /dev/random and /dev/urandom.  Be sure the entropy 
is generated from a truly random source, and is properly debiased.
